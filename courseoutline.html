<h2>Course Description:</h2>

<div class="plain-text">The purpose of this course is to introduce students to programming in a 
high-level text-based language. Students will learn fundamental concepts 
of computer programming, as well as essential practices for collaborative 
program design and development. The language used in this class will be Python.</div>


<h2>Required Materials:</h2>

<div class="plain-text"><ul>
  <li>School-issued laptop and charger</li>
  <li>Pencil</li>
  <li>Binder with lined paper OR spiral notebook and pocket folder</li>
</ul><div>

<div class="plain-text"><p>This is a computer programming course, but students will not work exclusively
on the computer. Written notes will be included for most topics, and some assignments
will have written components or may be entirely on paper.</p>

<p>This course will use Visual Studio Code for programming with the Python extension
and the additional package ipykernel, as well as the Python software itself. All of 
this software is free and open source.</p></div>

<h2>Extra Help:</h2>

<div class="plain-text">I will generally be available during Activity Period each day. Other times may be
arranged as necessary. If you have questions or would like extra help, it is your
responsibility to come and ask.</div>

<h2>Attendance:</h2>

<div class="plain-text">If you are absent you are responsible for making up missed work. Assignments will be
posted on Google Classroom; students can access directions and files for assignments
there. Students can also contact me via email at any time. Missed work is required to 
be made up no later than the number of days returning to school equivalent to the
number of days absent. (Example: If you are absent for two days you have two days to 
make up the missed work upon returning. Exceptions may be made upon request after
extended absences.)</div>

<h2>Grading Procedure:</h2>

<div class="plain-text"><p>This course will be graded in part by proficiency with each topic and in part by
successful completion of programs and projects. The categories are as follows:</p>

<b>Collaborative Proficiency</b> (<i>30% of marking period average</i>)
<br>
<b>Individual Proficiency</b> (<i>30% of marking period average</i>)
<br>
<b>Programs and Projects</b> (<i>30% of marking period average</i>)
<br>
<b>Participation</b> (<i>10% of marking period average</i>)

<h3>Proficiency:</h3>

<p>The Proficiency categories will be an assessment of proficiency level with each
concept in the course. Together they make up 60% of your overall average.</p>

<p>Collaborative Proficiency grades will be based on collaborative assignments;
group work is an essential component of this course, as programming is rarely a
solo endeavor. The finished product in collaborative assignments wll be evaluated
to determine the group members' proficiency level with the concepts addressed.
Individual Proficiency will be assessed similarly, but based on individual projects
and assessments.</p>

Proficiency grades will be determined according to the following rubric:
<table>
  <tr>
    <th>Score</th>
    <th>Progression Toward Mastery</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>0</td>
    <td>work not sumbitted or little work attempted on this concept</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>1</td>
    <td>Demonstrates limited proficiency with concept</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>2</td>
    <td>Approaching proficiency with concept (demonstrates partial understanding)</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>3</td>
    <td>Proficient with concept (demonstrates understanding, can apply the concept without errors)</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>4</td>
    <td>Demonstrates mastery of concept (can explain it to others and apply it in new ways</td>
  </tr>
</table>

<h3>Programs and Projects</h3>

You will complete several projects over the course of the semester. They will vary in length
and complexity; larger and more complex projects will be worth more within this category.
Each will be scored based on a rubric that will be provided to you at the start of the assignment.

<h3>Participation</h3>

The Participation category will include a variety of different assignment types. These may
include but are not limited to:

<ul>
  <li>Completing class notes</li>
  <li>Contributing to in-class group work tasks</li>
  <li>Paper assignments (may also be considered in assessing proficiency)</li>
</ul>

Each participation assignment will be scored out of 2 points using the following scale.

<table>
  <tr>
    <th>Score</th>
    <th>Meaning</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>0</td>
    <td>work not submitted or little work attempted</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>1</td>
    <td>partially complete</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>2</td>
    <td>complete</td>
  </tr>
</table>
