*Course Description:* 

The purpose of this course is to introduce students to programming in a high-level text-based language. Students will learn fundamental concepts of computer programming, as well as essential practices for collaborative program design and development. The language used in this class will be Python.

*Required Materials:*

- School-issued laptop and charger
- Pencil
- Binder with lined paper OR spiral notebook and pocket folder\*

\*This is a computer programming course, but students will not be working exclusively on the computer. Written notes will be included for several topics, and some assignments will have written components or may be entirely on paper.

This course will use Visual Studio Code for programming with the Python extension and the additional package ipykernel, as well as Python itself. All of this software is free and open source.



*Extra Help:*

I will generally be available during activity period each day.  Other times may be arranged as necessary.  If you have questions or would like extra help, it is your responsibility to come and ask.



*Attendance:*

If you are absent, you are responsible for making up missed work.  Assignments will be posted on the class web page <https://herrkm.github.io/intro-to-programming/> daily; students can access directions and files for assignments here. Students can also contact me via email at any time. Missed work is required to be made up no later than the number of days returning to school equivalent to the number of days absent. (Example: If you are absent for two days you have two days to make up the missed work upon returning.)

*Grading Procedure:*

This course will be graded in part by proficiency with each topic and in part by successful completion of programs and projects. The categories are as follows:

**Collaborative Proficiency** (*30% of marking period average*)

**Individual Proficiency** (*30% of marking period average*)

**Programs and Projects** (*30% of marking period average*)

**Participation** (*10% of marking period average*)


*Proficiency:*

The Proficiency categories will be an assessment of proficiency with each concept in the course. Together, they make up 60% of your overall average.

Collaborative Proficiency grades will be based on collaborative assignments; group work is an essential component of this course, as programming is rarely a solo endeavor. The finished product in collaborative assignments will be evaluated to determine the group members’ proficiency level with the concepts addressed. Individual Proficiency grades will be assessed similarly, but based on individual assignments and assessments.

Proficiency grades will be determined according to the following rubric:

|Score|Progression Toward Mastery|
| :- | :- |
|0|*Work not submitted or little work attempted on this concept*|
|1|*Demonstrates limited proficiency with concept*|
|2|*Approaching proficiency with concept (demonstrates partial understanding)*|
|3|*Proficient with concept (demonstrates understanding, can apply the concept without errors)*|
|4|*Demonstrates mastery of concept (can explain it to others and apply it in new ways)*|

*Programs and Projects*

You will complete several projects over the course of the semester. They will vary in length and complexity; larger and more complex projects will be worth more within this category. Each will be scored based on a rubric that will be provided to you at the start of the assignment. 

*Participation*

The Participation category will include a variety of different assignment types. These may include but are not limited to:

- Class notes (either traditionally in class or as homework after an exploration activity)
- Contributing to simple in-class group work tasks
- Completing whole group live-code tasks in class

Each participation assignment will be scored out of 2 points using the following scale.


|Score|Progression Toward Mastery|
| :- | :- |
|0|*work not submitted or little work attempted*|
|1|*partially complete*|
|2|*complete*|
